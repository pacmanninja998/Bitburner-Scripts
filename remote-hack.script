    This script requires 2.55 GB of RAM to run for 1 thread(s)

    This script will automatically hack the current server, unless it 
    is the home server or it is at the mySerers list.
    It is supposed to be copied over to the server which is to be 
    hacked. It won't work on a server that has 2GB of RAM or less.
